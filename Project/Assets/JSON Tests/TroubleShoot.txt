
Question:
Why do i get errors like this:

    "Assets/Plugins/SimpleJSON.cs(373,50): error CS0246: The type or namespace name `ICSharpCode' could not be found. Are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?"
    "Assets/Plugins/SimpleJSON.cs(487,39): error CS0246: The type or namespace name `ICSharpCode' could not be found. Are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?"
    "Assets/Plugins/SimpleJSON.cs(488,32): error CS1502: The best overloaded method match for `SimpleJSON.JSONNode.LoadFromStream(System.IO.Stream)' has some invalid arguments"
    "Assets/Plugins/SimpleJSON.cs(488,32): error CS1503: Argument `#1' cannot convert `object' expression to type `System.IO.Stream'"


Answer:
You compiled the SimpleJSON.cs file with the USE_SharpZipLib option which tells the compiler to include extra code from an external assembly called "ICSharpCode.SharpZipLib.dll". This assembly is needed to use compression.

To fix this you either have to:

 - get the SharpZipLib ( http://www.icsharpcode.net/opensource/sharpziplib/ ) and place it next to the SimpleJSON.cs file.
 - or comment out the first line in the SimpleJSON.cs file which contains "#define USE_SharpZipLib".

If you remove or comment out the define of "USE_SharpZipLib" you can no longer use the "compressed" load and save functions:

    SaveToCompressedStream()
    SaveToCompressedFile()
    SaveToCompressedBase64()

    LoadFromCompressedStream()
    LoadFromCompressedFile()
    LoadFromCompressedBase64()

In this case you don't need the SharpZipLib.

Question:
Why do i get errors like this:

    "Exception: Can't use compressed functions. You need include the SharpZipLib and uncomment the define at the top of SimpleJSON"

Answer:

You tried to use the compressed load or save functions but the SimpleJSON.cs has been compiled without the "USE_SharpZipLib" define at the top.

To fix this you have to

 - get the SharpZipLib ( http://www.icsharpcode.net/opensource/sharpziplib/ ).
 - place the "ICSharpCode.SharpZipLib.dll" next to the "SimpleJSON.cs" file.
 - make sure the SimpleJSON.cs has a define at the top that looks like this: #define USE_SharpZipLib

Question:

Why do i get errors like this:

    "JSON Parse: Too many closing brackets"
    "JSON Parse: Quotation marks seems to be messed up"

Answer:

You passed a malformed JSON string to JSON.Parse() or JSONNode.Parse(). The parser only has basic error checks implemented. If you see one of this exceptions your JSON really has to be messed up.

To fix those problems just copy the string you tried to parse and paste it on http://jsonlint.com/ and press Validate to see where your string is messed up.

If you think you're sure that your JSON is valid, please check the RFC http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4627 . The parser should be able to parse any valid JSON string into a tree-structure.

Note: The JSON string generation doesn't follow the rfc rules since the parser treats all values as strings. That means the recreation of a JSON string from a tree structure doesn't have to match the original string.
