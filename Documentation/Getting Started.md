# Getting Started

*Prairie* is a set of tools for [Unity](www.unity3d.com) designed to allow non-programmers to add annotations and user interaction to digital historical environments.

This document will walk you through the fundamentals of using *Prairie*.

## The Unity Editor
*Prairie* is a selection of pre-made Unity scripts and assets to be used inside of the Unity editor workflow. As such, using *Prairie* requires a basic working knowledge of the Unity editor (don’t worry — no coding experience is required).

The following set of videos (each a digestible 3 minutes or so) will provide you with a good sense of the editor, scene view, and key concepts moving forward, (without any coding):

### Key Terms
Coming back from a long break from Unity and need a refresh? Coming from a different game engine, or a computer science background? Just don’t want to watch any videos and are confident you’ll pick it up? Here are a handful of key terms you’ll certainly want to refresh yourself on:

| Unity Term | Similar Concepts | Definition |
|-|-|-:|
| Asset | Resource | Files which are saved in your project’s Assets directory. Everything which makes up your game is saved as an asset of various kinds (scenes, 3d models, textures, sounds, scripts, etc). |
| Scene | Map, Level | A physical space containing other assets, arranged and configured to create an interactive experience. The end product of your project are the scenes you create. |
| Game Object | Entity, Object | Instances of *anything* in the game scene. Including lights, text, players, walls, and even abstract things, like triggers. All Game Objects have a position, rotation, and size. |
| Prefab | Blueprint, Class | Preconfigured Game Objects, which can be saved as assets for reuse |
| Component | Script, Behavior | Game Objects are assigned multiple components which define how they work in the game. A player object would have a movement component so it moves when a players gives input as well as a collider component so they can’t walk through walls. |
| Property | Field, Component Setting | Each component has properties that can be adjusted in the inspector to modify how it behaves. For example, a light component has a color property. |
